8   added the option of prim versus conv in inputting kpoints in kpbs.params
    replaced all real(8) by real(r15) so that the kind can be changed in one place only
8.1 corrected the elastic constants and FD and pert calculation part of the group velocities ; aded module mech
    added the defaults.params file for user to change tolerance,svdcut,rcutoff,maxterms if needed
    added module linalg for append_array, symmetrizing
8.2 keeping full matrix a_hom, but processing it later according to include_fc flag 
8.3 definig the IBZ with weights in order to calculate sums over BZ for doing thermodynamics
    Adding thermodynamics to the harmonic calculations with harmonic pressure, E, F, Cv as a funtion ot T 
8.4 extending setforce_displacement matrix to any order (limiting to 8 in practice) and translational invariances also to 8th order
8.5 fixing the keep_grp2 terms to keep, QHA results with constant bulk modulus 
8.6 used the soft convention of the phase in the dynamical matrix and structure factor for the NA_coulomb terms; 
    added a T-dependent or volume-dependent bulk modulus 
    added the harmonic dielectric matrix due to phonons (optical at zone center)
    added the condition to be inside the WS cell of the supercell when constructing the dynamical matrix
    added info about the # of groups, termsindep and terms to lat_fc.dat, useful for reading fc data (ph program) before allocation
8.7 set of fcs restricted to those within the supercell rgrid and having still full symmetry of the crystal
    same was done and tested for sf(q)
8.8 read the range, but only keep fc2indeps that are within the WS cell of the supercell, and throw away the ones outside; 
    (this is completed by symmetry)
    write symmetry matrices in a separate file
    nshells 2nd dimension increased from 20 natoms per primitive cell
    modified and moved band sorting operations inside the bandsort subroutine
    modified svd to svd_ridge to include proper regularization
    removed from set_dynamical_matrix the condition if inside WS because this breaks symmetry
    added a subroutine to show boundary of the WS cell of the FBZ (output used for display in fcs.plt)
    updated the default values of defaults.params
    added boundary to check_inside in extratools.f90
    bulk modulus made volume-dependent through the use of gruneisen (for QHA calculations)
    a bug in the op_kmatrix was fixed, so that in the primitive representation it is now integer(unimodular).
8.9 added the storage of FC2 and the dynamical matrix in the 5D array form (al,be,tau,taup,grid) 
    so that the dyn can be calculated at the Gsc grid exactly, dyn_NA subtracted on this grid and 
    then fourier back to get short-ranged part of FC2 which can be used to get dyn at any q point
    fixed fold_ws function that folds a vector in the WS cell and also modified get weights
    introduced Voigt, Reuss and Hill(avge) elastic moduli and vsound in those terms
8.10 added the option of reading force constants and computing phonons and QHA-EOS without fitting
     added the correction to the gruneisen for non-zero u0 
     added rotational invariance check to qiu
     added strain-dependent energy to QHA, added B_0' and volume-dependent B=B_0(1-3*eta*B0')
     added checks for symmetries in zeta, Qiu, and inversion symmetry, b0p

8.11 extended the arrays keep_fc2i and counter2i(g,ti) to all ranks: keep_fci(rank,group,ti), counteri(rank,g,ti), current(rank,g,ti)
     fixed bug in group velocities from HF, so that they now agree with finite-difference 
     changed variable from svdcut to its square root which is the force error
     updated nkeptind to all ranks so that after setup_maps, in setup of amatrix only nkeptind is used
  
8.12 for fc2range=0 (full supercell FC2s) subtract NA from the dynamical matrix at(G_sc) but
     otherwise if fc2range.ne.0 subtract Coulomb force from forces before fitting. Addition process of NA to 
     dynamical matrix a general q is the same
     Added B'0, and possibly the cubic elastic constants. 
     Added Cp=Cv+BTa^2 for volumetric heat capacity
     Added harmonic contribution to the dielectric constant

8.15 Finally fixed NA terms. Use by default born_flag=2 which subtracts ewalfd force from DFT force regardless of fc2flag
     Fixed group velocities

8.16 Cleaned up some details bout elastic constants, added the Leontiev-Agne formula for gamma, alpha and Cp in the QHA

to do:  
-make group velocities volume-dependent using gruneisen
-for include_fc=2 reads fcs(rnk) from a file, and properly store it in the 1D array fcs(ngr?) for usage in the setup_amatrix code.
-Add Ewald sum to the potential energy part of SCOP8 : that goes in the free energy and its gradient wrt u0 and eta and K!!!
-Compare the size of W and that of nindepfc. If w is smaller then is CS needed to reduce them?
-project dos on atoms in the tetrahedron method 
-Fix the conductance
-Fix Huang to add QAQ term?

-Give option to read FCs and directly do phonon and elastic properties.=> implemented in ph.x
