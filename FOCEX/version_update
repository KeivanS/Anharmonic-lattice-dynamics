8   added the option of prim versus conv in inputting kpoints in kpbs.params
    replaced all real(8) by real(r15) so that the kind can be changed in one place only
8.1 corrected the elastic constants and FD and pert calculation part of the group velocities ; aded module mech
    added the defaults.params file for user to change tolerance,svdcut,rcutoff,maxterms if needed
    added module linalg for append_array, symmetrizing
8.2 keeping full matrix a_hom, but processing it later according to include_fc flag 
8.3 definig the IBZ with weights in order to calculate sums over BZ for doing thermodynamics
    Adding thermodynamics to the harmonic calculations with harmonic pressure, E, F, Cv as a funtion ot T 
8.4 extending setforce_displacement matrix to any order (limiting to 8 in practice) and translational invariances also to 8th order
8.5 fixing the keep_grp2 terms to keep, QHA results with constant bulk modulus 
8.6 used the soft convention of the phase in the dynamical matrix and structure factor for the NA_coulomb terms; 
    added a T-dependent or volume-dependent bulk modulus 
    added the harmonic dielectric matrix due to phonons (optical at zone center)
    added the condition to be inside the WS cell of the supercell when constructing the dynamical matrix
    added info about the # of groups, termsindep and terms to lat_fc.dat, useful for reading fc data (ph program) before allocation
8.7 set of fcs restricted to those within the supercell rgrid and having still full symmetry of the crystal
    same was done and tested for sf(q)
8.8 read the range, but only keep fc2indeps that are within the WS cell of the supercell, and throw away the ones outside; 
    (this is completed by symmetry)
    write symmetry matrices in a separate file
    nshells 2nd dimension increased from 20 to 90 upper limit of atoms per primitive cell
    modified and moved band sorting operations inside the bandsort subroutine
    modified svd to svd_ridge to include proper regularization
    removed from set_dynamical_matrix the condition if inside WS because this breaks symmetry
    added a subroutine to show boundary of the WS cell of the FBZ (output used for display in fcs.plt)
    updated the default values of defaults.params
    added boundary to check_inside in extratools.f90

to do:  
-make bulk modulus also volume-dependent since group velocities are now vol-dependent thanks to gruneisen
-for include_fc=2 reads fcs(rnk) from a file, and properly store it in the 1D array fcs(ngr?) for usage in the setup_amatrix code.
-Add Ewald sum to the potential energy part of SCOP8 : that goes in the free energy and its gradient wrt u0 and eta and K!!!
-Compare the size of W and that of nindepfc. If w is smaller then is CS needed to reduce them?
-Add harmonic contribution to the dielectric constant
-project dos on atoms in the tetrahedron method
